    <h1 class="about_game">About Game</h1>
    <p class="text">In an incremental <span>game</span>, a player presses a button and receives a certain amount of currency. The player can <span>"spend
        the earned "money"</span>" to purchase game items or skills that will allow the player to earn currency faster or
        automatically, <span>even without having to press buttons</span>.<br><br> Often in such games there are sources of income that
        earn a <span>certain amount of coins for a certain time</span>. For example, these can be buildings, factories or farms. Each
        of these <span>sources increases</span> the amount of currency earned per second.<br><br> But the <span>cost of buildings</span> is also growing
        exponentially, so the transition, say, from a third-level building to a fourth-level building takes the same
        time as the transition from the first building to the second (sometimes even more). <span>Some games use a progress
        reset system</span>. <br><br> The player resets the progress, but gets a new kind of game currency. This new currency is usually
        used to get bonuses that do not disappear after the reset. These bonuses <span>allow the player to achieve greater
        game results</span> than without resetting progress. Games like <span>Cookie Clicker</span> allow players to play endlessly, and
        in <span>Candy Box</span>! you can reach the end of the game.</p>
